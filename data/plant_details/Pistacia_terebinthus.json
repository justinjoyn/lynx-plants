    "introduction": "Pistacia terebinthus also called the terebinth /\u02c8t\u025br\u0259\u02ccb\u026an\u03b8/ and the turpentine tree, is a deciduous shrub species of the genus Pistacia, native to the Mediterranean region from the western regions of Morocco and Portugal to Greece and western and southeastern Turkey. At one time terebinths growing on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea (in Syria, Lebanon and Israel) were regarded as a separate species, Pistacia palaestina,[2] but these are now considered to be a synonym of P. terebinthus.",
