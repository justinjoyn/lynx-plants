    "introduction": "Rosa virginiana, commonly known as the Virginia rose,[2] common wild rose or prairie rose, is a woody perennial in the rose family native to eastern North America, where it is the most common wild rose.[3] It is deciduous, forming a suckering shrub up to 2 metres in height, though often less. The stems are covered in numerous hooked prickles. The leaves are pinnate, usually with between 7 and 9 glossy leaflets. The pink flowers are borne singly or in small clusters and appear over a long period in midsummer. The fruits are small, round and bright red, rich in vitamin C and edible, being both used to make jams and tea.[4] It grows in clearings, thickets, and shores.[5] The plant attracts birds, bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds.[6]\n\nCharles and Bridget Quest-Ritson describe R. virginiana as \"the best all-rounder among the wild roses\", and draw attention to its leaf coloration in the fall: \"the whole plant turns yellow, orange, scarlet, crimson and brown for weeks on end\".[7]\n\nIn cultivation, this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[8]",
