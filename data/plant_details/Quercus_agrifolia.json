    "introduction": "Quercus agrifolia, the California live oak,[3] or coast live oak, is an evergreen[4] live oak native to the California Floristic Province. Live oaks are so-called because they keep living leaves on the tree all year, adding young leaves and shedding dead leaves simultaneously rather than dropping dead leaves en masse in the autumn like a true deciduous tree.[5] Coast live oaks may be shrubby, depending on age and growing location, but is generally a medium-sized tree.[6] It grows west of the Sierra Nevada mountain range from Mendocino County, California, south to northern Baja California in Mexico.[7] It is classified in the red oak section of oaks (Quercus sect. Lobatae).[8]\n\nThis species is commonly sympatric with canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), and the two may be hard to distinguish because their spinose leaves are superficially similar.",
