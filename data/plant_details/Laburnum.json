    "introduction": "Laburnum, sometimes called golden chain or golden rain, is a genus of two species of small trees in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. The species are Laburnum anagyroides\u2014common laburnum and Laburnum alpinum\u2014alpine laburnum. They are native to the mountains of southern Europe from France to the Balkans.\n\nSome botanists include a third species, Laburnum caramanicum, but this native of southeast Europe and Anatolia is usually treated in a distinct genus Podocytisus, more closely allied to the Genisteae (brooms).",
