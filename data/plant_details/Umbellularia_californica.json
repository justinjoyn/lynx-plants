    "introduction": "Umbellularia californica is a large hardwood tree native to coastal forests and the Sierra foothills of California, and to coastal forests extending into Oregon.[2] It is the sole species in the genus Umbellularia. The tree's pungent leaves have a similar flavor to bay leaves, though stronger, and it may be mistaken for bay laurel.\n\nThe tree is endemic to the California Floristic Province. It is a host of the pathogen that causes sudden oak death. The dry wood has a color range from blonde (like maple) to brown (like walnut). It is considered an excellent tonewood and is sought after by luthiers and woodworkers.",
