    "introduction": "Achillea tomentosa, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is sometimes kept as a garden plant, and occasionally naturalizes outside its original range of dry lowland habitats of southern Europe and (possibly) western Asia. It is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[2]",
    "description": "Achillea tomentosa is quite similar in appearance to Achillea millefolium (common yarrow), but typically has yellow ligules, more numerous disc florets, and straw\u2011colored involucral bracts with translucent margins.[3] Additionally, A. tomentosa is diploid, unlike the polyploid common yarrow.[4]"
