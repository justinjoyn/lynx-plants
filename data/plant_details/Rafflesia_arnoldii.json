It is a species of flowering plant in the parasitic genus Rafflesia within the family Rafflesiaceae. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on Earth.[4] It has a strong and unpleasant odor of decaying flesh.[5] It is native to the rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo.[6][7] Although there are some plants with larger flowering organs like the titan arum (Amorphophallus titanum) and talipot palm (Corypha umbraculifera), those are technically clusters of many flowers.\n\nRafflesia arnoldii is one of the three national flowers in Indonesia, the other two being the white jasmine (Jasminum sambac) and moon orchid (Phalaenopsis amabilis).[8] It was officially recognized as a national \"rare flower\" (Indonesian: puspa langka) in Presidential Decree No. 4 in 1993.[9]",
