    "introduction": "Azolla (common called mosquito fern, water fern, and fairy moss) is a genus of seven species of aquatic ferns in the family Salviniaceae. They are extremely reduced in form and specialized, looking nothing like other typical ferns but more resembling the form of some mosses or even duckweeds. Azolla filiculoides is one of two fern species for which a reference genome has been published.[2] It is believed that this genus grew so prolifically during the Eocene (and thus absorbed such a large amount of carbon) that it triggered a global cooling event that has lasted to the present.[3]\n\nAzolla may establish as an invasive plant in areas where it is not native [where?]. In such a situation it can alter aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity substantially.[4]",
