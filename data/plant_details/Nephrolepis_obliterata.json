    "introduction": "Nephrolepis obliterata, the Kimberley Queen fern or Australian swordfern,[1] is a species of fern in the family Nephrolepidaceae.[2] This fern originated in Australia, but is relatively easy to cultivate indoors worldwide.[3]\n\nThe often misspelled \"Kimberley Queen\" name correctly has a second \"e\" in the first name as is trademarked by Westland Laboratories Ply. Ltd.\n\nThe Kimberley Queen is not as well known as the Boston fern. Because it is not as sensitive to a lack of humidity, it is better suited for the typical indoor environment.\n\nNephrolepis obliterata prefer bright, but indirect sunlight. Temperatures between 16 \u00b0C and 24 \u00b0C are best. Nephrolepis obliterata is sensitive to both too little and too much water, so water the plant well but permit the soil to dry out between waterings.[4]\n\nNephrolepis obliterata has the added benefit of reducing indoor air pollution, particularly formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene.[5]",
