    "introduction": "Physostegia virginiana, the obedient plant, obedience or false dragonhead,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to North America, where it is distributed from eastern Canada to northern Mexico.[2] Physostegia are known commonly as obedient plants because a flower pushed to one side will often stay in that position.[3] The name \u201cfalse dragonhead\u201d refers to the dragonheads of the related Dracocephalum,[3] a genus to which the plant once belonged.[1]",
