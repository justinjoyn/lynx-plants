    "introduction": "Atropa bella-donna, commonly known as deadly nightshade or belladonna, is a toxic perennial herbaceous plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae,[1][2] which also includes tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant. It is native to Europe and Western Asia, including Turkey, its distribution extending from England in the west to western Ukraine and the Iranian province of Gilan in the east. It is also naturalised or introduced in some parts of Canada, North Africa and the United States.\n\nThe foliage and berries are extremely toxic when ingested, containing tropane alkaloids.[2][3][4][5] These toxins include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which cause delirium and hallucinations,[2][3][4][6][7] and are also used as pharmaceutical anticholinergics.[2] Tropane alkaloids are of common occurrence not only in the Old World tribes Hyoscyameae (to which the genus Atropa belongs) and Mandragoreae, but also in the New World tribe Datureae\u2014all of which belong to the subfamily Solanoideae of the plant family Solanaceae.[2]\n\nAtropa bella-donna has unpredictable effects.[3] The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.[8]\n\nThe potentially deadly ripe fruit can be distinguished from the similar Solanum nigrum by its larger berry size, its much larger calyx than S. nigrum that extends wider than the fruit (either encasing it or extending flat), and that A. bella-donna bears its berries singly, whilst S. nigrum has its berries in clusters located on a descending stem, similar to tomatoes. Solanum nigrum has other potentially toxic look alikes and should be identified with certainty before attempts at foraging. This plant's overall structure looks similar to an aubergine, but its flower looks a little bit different. This plant's flowers are very attractive, looking like a tomato flower, and its fruits are ball-shaped.[citation needed] It is very dangerous to consume.",
