    "introduction": "Saffron (/\u02c8s\u00e6fr\u0259n, -r\u0252n/)[1] is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the \"saffron crocus\". The vivid crimson stigma and styles, called threads, are collected and dried for use mainly as a seasoning and colouring agent in food. The saffron crocus was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.\n\nSaffron's taste and iodoform-like or hay-like fragrance result from the phytochemicals picrocrocin and safranal.[2][3] It also contains a carotenoid pigment, crocin, which imparts a rich golden-yellow hue to dishes and textiles. Its recorded history is attested in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical treatise,[4] and it has been traded and used for thousands of years. As of 2024, Iran produced some 90% of the world total for saffron.[5][6] At US$5,000 per kg or higher, saffron has long been the world's costliest spice by weight.[7][8][9]",
