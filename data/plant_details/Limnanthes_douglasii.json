    "introduction": "Limnanthes douglasii is a species of annual flowering plant in the family Limnanthaceae (meadowfoam) commonly known as Douglas' meadowfoam[1] or poached egg plant. It is native to California and Oregon, where it grows in wet, grassy habitat, such as vernal pools and spring meadows. It can grow in poorly drained clay soils. The plant was collected by the Scottish explorer and botanist David Douglas, who worked on the west coast of America in the 1820s.\n\nThe plant usually bears white flowers with yellow centers, hence the name \"poached egg plant\", but flower color can vary across subspecies. It is a popular ornamental plant. It attracts hoverflies and is pollinated by bees. It is self-seeding, even in a lawn.\n\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[2][3]\n\nThere are six subspecies:\n\nThe exact amount of subspecies had been disputed, with some arguing that there are four subspecies of Limnanthes douglasii, though existing species are highly polymorphic.[5]\n\nAndrena pulverea (syn. limnanthii) is a species of mining bee that specializes in pollinating the flowers of L. douglasii subsp. rosea.[6][7]",
