    "introduction": "Asplenium flabellifolium is commonly known as the necklace fern, butterfly fern and walking fern.[1][2][3] This small fern occurs in all states of Australia, as well as in New Zealand.[3][4] It was initially described by Spanish botanist Antonio Jos\u00e9 Cavanilles.[5]\n\nIts natural habitats are open forest or rainforest. Usually on the ground, but sometimes epiphytic. Often seen in rock crevices, caves, on fallen logs and tree trunks, beside streams, or near cliffs, or waterfalls.[3][4]\n\nThe fronds are 10 to 20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 in) long, with 5 to 20 pairs of pinnae (leaflets), often fan-shaped or sometimes lanceolate.[3][4]",
