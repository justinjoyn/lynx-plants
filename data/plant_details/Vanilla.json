    "introduction": "Vanilla, the vanilla orchids, forms a flowering plant genus of about 110 species in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). This evergreen genus occurs worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, from tropical America to tropical Asia, New Guinea and West Africa.[1] Five species are known from the contiguous United States, all limited to southern Florida.[2]\n\nThe most widely known member is the flat-leaved vanilla (V. planifolia), native to Mexico and Belize,[3] from which commercial vanilla flavoring is derived. It is the only orchid widely used for industrial purposes in flavoring such products as foods, beverages and cosmetics, and is recognized as the most popular aroma and flavor.[4] The key constituent imparting its flavour is the phenolic aldehyde vanillin.[5]\n\nThe genus was established in 1754 by Plumier, after J. Miller. The word vanilla, derived from the diminutive of the Spanish word vaina (vaina itself meaning sheath or pod), simply translates as little pod.",
