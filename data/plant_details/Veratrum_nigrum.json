    "introduction": "Veratrum nigrum, the black false hellebore,[2][3] is a widespread Eurasian species of perennial flowering plant in the family Melanthiaceae.[1][4] Despite its common name, V. nigrum is not closely related to the true hellebores, nor does it resemble them.\n\nThe plant was widely known even in ancient times. For example, Lucretius (ca. 99 BCE ca. 55 BCE) and Pliny the Elder (23 AD August 25, 79) both knew of its medicinal emetic as well as deadly toxic properties.[5]",
