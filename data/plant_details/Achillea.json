    "introduction": "Achillea /\u00e6k\u026a\u02c8li\u02d0\u0259/[4] is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to A. millefolium. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds;[5] this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.",
