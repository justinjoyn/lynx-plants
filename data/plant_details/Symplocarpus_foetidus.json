    "introduction": "Symplocarpus foetidus, commonly known as skunk cabbage[5] or eastern skunk cabbage (also swamp cabbage, clumpfoot cabbage, or meadow cabbage, foetid pothos or polecat weed), is a low-growing plant that grows in wetlands and moist hill slopes of eastern North America. Bruised leaves present an odor reminiscent of skunk.\n\nSymplocarpus combines the Greek word symploce, meaning \"connection\" and carpos, meaning \"fruit\", to indicate that the plant has a compound fruit.[6][7]\n\nLinnaeus gave the plant its species name of foetidus, Latin for \"bad-smelling\".[8] The plant produces a strong odor, which is repulsive to many but sometimes described as smelling like \"fresh cabbage with a slight suggestion of mustard\".[7] The odor increases in intensity over time, as the plant matures, likely due to increased ripeness in the plant's stamens.[7]",
