    "introduction": "Solanum carolinense, the Carolina horsenettle,[2] is not a true nettle, but a member of the Solanaceae, or nightshade family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant, native to the southeastern United States, though its range has expanded throughout much of temperate North America.[3] The plant is an invasive in parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.[4][5] The stem and undersides of larger leaf veins are covered with prickles.\n\n\"Horsenettle\" is also written \"horse nettle\" or \"horse-nettle\", though USDA publications usually use the one-word form. Though there are other horsenettle nightshades, S. carolinense is the species most commonly called \"the horsenettle\". Other common names include radical weed, sand brier or briar, bull nettle, tread-softly, Solanum mammosum (\"apple of Sodom\"), devil's tomato and wild tomato.",
