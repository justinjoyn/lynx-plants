    "introduction": "Allium giganteum, common name giant onion or giant leek, is an Asian species of onion in the Onion Family (Alliaceae), native to central and southwestern Asia but cultivated in many countries as a flowering garden plant.[4][5] It is the tallest species of Allium in common cultivation, growing to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft).[6]\n\nIn early to midsummer, small globes of intense purple umbels appear, followed by attractive fruiting umbels. A popular cultivar, 'Globemaster', is shorter (80 centimetres (31 in)) but produces much larger, deep violet, umbels (1520 centimetres (5.97.9 in)). These globular umbels can contain thousands of florets (i.e. tiny flowers). A bulb dealer in Arcadia, California, counted 5286 florets from a single umbel.[7] Both varieties have been granted the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[8][9][10]\n\nIn nature, the species is found in Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.[3] In cultivation in the US, it performs well in USDA hardiness zones 610.[11]\n\nEating flowers, seeds, leaves, and stems can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to the sulfides they contain.[12]",
