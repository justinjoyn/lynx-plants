    "introduction": "Pistacia eurycarpa, commonly as Persian turpentine tree,[2] is a species of Pistacia native to southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Iran, Armenia, and Antilebanon.[1] It is called qezwan (\u0642\u06d5\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0646) or dareben (\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06d5\u0628\u06d5\u0646) in Kurdish. It is morphologically close to Pistacia atlantica subsp. mutica, but differs by having distinctly compressed fruits (width larger than length).[3]\n\nHaving a watery flavour, its resin is used as a chewing gum to relieve upper abdominal discomfort, stomach aches, dyspepsia and peptic ulcer.[4]",
