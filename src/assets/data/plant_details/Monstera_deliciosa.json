    "introduction": "Monstera deliciosa, the Swiss cheese plant[2] or split-leaf philodendron[3] is a species of flowering plant native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama.[4] It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. It is very widely grown in temperate zones as a houseplant.\n\nThe common name \"Swiss cheese plant\" is also used for the related species from the same genus, Monstera adansonii.[5] The common name \"split-leaf philodendron\" is also used for the species Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, although neither species is in the genus Philodendron.[3]",
