    "introduction": "Pomaderris kumeraho or k\u016bmarahou, also known as gumdigger's soap and golden tainui, is a plant endemic to the North Island of New Zealand. The name k\u016bmarahou is a M\u0101ori word signifying a shrub.[1] K\u016bmarahou grows up to four meters in height, and flowers in September, with yellow blossoms. The name \"gumdigger's soap\" was given owing to the lather created when the flowers were rubbed with water.\n\nK\u016bmarahou has many uses in traditional M\u0101ori medicine, although there is little scientific confirmation of its benefits.[2] Infusions of the leaves have been said to relieve various respiratory ailments and skin disorders.[3]",
