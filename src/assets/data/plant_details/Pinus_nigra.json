    "introduction": "Pinus nigra, the Austrian pine[2] or black pine, is a moderately variable species of pine, occurring across Southern Europe from the Iberian Peninsula[3] to the eastern Mediterranean, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey, Corsica and Cyprus, as well as Crimea and in the high mountains of Northwest Africa. The world's oldest black pine, located in the Banaz district of U\u015fak, T\u00fcrkiye, is estimated to be 1000 years old. This makes it significant in the country, which is known for a very dry climate, inhospitable for most trees. It has a height of 11 meters, a diameter of 3 meters and a circumference of 9.60 meters.[4]",
