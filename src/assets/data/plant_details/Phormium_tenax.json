    "introduction": "Phormium tenax (called flax in New Zealand English; harakeke in M\u0101ori; New Zealand flax[1][2] outside New Zealand; and New Zealand hemp[1] in historical nautical contexts) is an evergreen perennial plant native to New Zealand and Norfolk Island that is an important fibre plant and a popular ornamental plant.[3] The plant grows as a clump of long, straplike leaves, up to two metres long, from which arises a much taller flowering shoot, with dramatic yellow or red flowers.[3]\n\nDespite being commonly known as 'flax', harakeke is of the genus Phormium and is a leaf fibre, whereas flax (linen) is of the genus Linum and is a bast fibre (which comes from the stem of the plant). The two plants have no relationship with each other.\n\nThe fibre has been widely used since the arrival of M\u0101ori to New Zealand, originally in M\u0101ori traditional textiles and also in rope and sail making[4][2] after the arrival of Europeans until at least WWII. It is an invasive species in some of the Pacific Islands and in Australia.[5]\n\nThe blades of the plant contain cucurbitacins, which are poisonous to some animals, and some of them are among the bitterest tastes to humans.[6]",
