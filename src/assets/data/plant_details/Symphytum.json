    "introduction": "Symphytum is a genus of flowering plants in the borage family, Boraginaceae, known by the common name comfrey (pronounced /\u02c8k\u028cmfri/, from the Latin confervere to 'heal' or literally to 'boil together', referring to uses in ancient traditional medicine).\n\nSymphytum is native to northern temperate regions of Asia and North America, with a wide introduced distribution on both continents.[2] There are 59 recognized species.[2] Some species and hybrids, particularly S. officinale, Symphytum grandiflorum, and S. \u00d7 uplandicum, are used in gardening and herbal medicine. Species in the genus Symphytum are different from Andersonglossum virginianum, known as wild comfrey, which is another member of the borage family.[3]",
