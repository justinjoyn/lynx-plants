It is native to Europe, Africa, Australia and much of Asia. It has been introduced to the Americas.[2][3] Contrary to its common name, it is not native to Bermuda and is in fact an abundant invasive species there. In Bermuda it has been known as \"crab grass\" (also a name for Digitaria sanguinalis).
