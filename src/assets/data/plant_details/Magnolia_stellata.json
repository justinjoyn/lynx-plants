    "introduction": "Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia,[1] is a slow-growing deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It bears large, showy white or pink flowers in early spring, before its leaves open. This species is closely related to the Kobushi magnolia (Magnolia kobus), and is treated by many botanists as a variety or even a cultivar of that.[citation needed] However, Magnolia stellata was accepted as a distinct species in the 1998 monograph by Hunt.[2]",
