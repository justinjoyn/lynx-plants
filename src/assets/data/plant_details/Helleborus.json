    "introduction": "Commonly known as hellebores (/\u02c8h\u025bl\u0259b\u0254\u02d0rz/), the Eurasian[2] genus Helleborus consists of approximately 20 species of herbaceous or evergreen perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, within which it gave its name to the tribe of Helleboreae. Many hellebore[3] species are poisonous.\n\nDespite common names such as winter rose,[4] Christmas rose, and Lenten rose, hellebores are not closely related to the rose family (Rosaceae).[5]",
