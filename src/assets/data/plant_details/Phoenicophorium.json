    "introduction": "Phoenicophorium, the thief palm, is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. The sole species is Phoenicophorium borsigianum.\n\nIt is endemic to the Seychelles, being fairly widespread on the larger islands of the group, such as Mah\u00e9, Silhouette, Praslin, and La Digue.[2]\n\nIt is found in forests, but is one of only a few native plants in the Seychelles that can colonise dry and eroded areas, as it is capable of withstanding full sunlight and periods of drought.[3]\n\nA palm growing in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1857 was stolen, giving rise to the common name of 'thief palm'.[3]",
