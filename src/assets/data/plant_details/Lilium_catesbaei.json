    "introduction": "Lilium catesbaei, sometimes known as Catesby's lily, pine lily,[1] leopard lily, tiger lily, or southern-red lily[3] is a native of Florida and the coastal regions of the American Southeast, where it usually grows in damp areas from Louisiana to Virginia.[4]\n\nLilium catesbaei requires hot, wet, acidic soil inhospitable to most other lily species.[5] Producing a single flower, it generally blooms late in the year. The flower is upright with 6 tepals (petals and sepals that look very similar). The tepals are curved backward and are orange toward the tip, yellow and purple-spotted toward the base.[6][7]",
