    "introduction": "Viburnum rhytidophyllum, the leatherleaf viburnum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Viburnaceae.[1] It is native to Asia.\n\nThis vigorous, coarsely textured evergreen shrub has an upright habit and 8-inch (20 cm) long, lustrous, deeply veined oval leaves with dark blue-green surfaces and pale green undersides. The leaf stems are fuzzy brown. In spring, fragrant creamy-white flowers bloom in clusters. Blue berries form in June and become plump through September, maturing to glossy black. Plants grow 1015 feet (3.04.6 m) tall and wide.\n\nThe plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree with a suckering habit. The leaves are opposite, crinkled, downy on the underside, less so on the upper surface.\n\nIt is commonly grown as an ornamental plant for its evergreen foliage and tolerance of deep shade.[2]",
