    "introduction": "Juncus kraussii commonly known as salt marsh rush, sea rush, jointed rush, matting rush or dune slack rush, is of the monocot family Juncaceae and genus Juncus. It grows in salt marshes, estuarine and coastal areas.[1]\n\nThis species is ideal as a stabiliser in estuary banks and riparian zones that adjoin developed areas;[2][3] it prevents erosion and also provides an excellent fibre for weaving.[4]\n\nThe plant is named after a German naturalist and museum curator, Christian Krauss, who travelled to South Africa.",
