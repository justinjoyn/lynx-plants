    "introduction": "Brassica oleracea is a plant of the family Brassicaceae, also known as wild cabbage in its uncultivated form. The species evidently originated from feral populations of related plants in the Eastern Mediterranean, where it was most likely first cultivated. It has many common cultivars used as vegetables, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy cabbage, kohlrabi, and gai lan.",
